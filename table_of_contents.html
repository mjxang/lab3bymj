        <td>Welcome to The Brick Fan, your source for LEGO news, reviews, and discussions. My name is Allen Tran and I love LEGO. I mean, who doesn’t love LEGO? You take little bricks and create wonders with your imagination. Growing up with the basic bricks and building crazy and colorful structures and vehicles made me happy. After two decades in the “Dark Ages,” now I’m all grown up and I’m proud to be an AFOL (Adult Fans of LEGO).</td>
